# Investigating Factors affecting the persistency of drugs

One of the long-lasting business issues in the world of Pharmaceutical companies is the persistency of drugs which can significantly affect the outcome of medical treatments. One of the important factors that is related to persistency is the adherence of the patient to the prescribed regimens, meaning if the patient is committed to the prescribed regimens or not. In fact, related studies show that around 50%-60% of the patients with different illnesses in US miss doses, take the wrong doses, or drop off treatment in the first year. Additionally, the illness, either chronic or acute can be related to the adherence and persistency of drugs. To solve the problem, we need to find out factors that are the most correlated to the persistence of drugs and adherence.

This project is a group project in which me with other team members,Bao Khanh Nguyen, Guillermo Leija, and Zain Ul Haq from different parts of the world developed machine learning models for predicting the persistency of drugs. We concluded that the XGBoost Classifier gives the higher accuracy compared to other models.
